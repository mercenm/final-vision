# Implementation of the Polyakov Action Minimization for Efficient Color Image Processing

# Abstract
The Laplace-Beltrami operator is an extension of the Laplacian. It was proven to be useful for color image processing as it models a meaningful coupling between the color channels. This is expressed in the Beltrami framework in which a color image is regarded as a map between two dimentional cartetian space to a five-dimensional, spatialchromatic $(x,y,R,G,B)$ space.
    
The Beltrami filter defined by this framework minimizes the Polyakov
action, adopted from high-energy physics, which measures the area of the
image manifold. Where in the paper we achieve to implement'The Polyakov Action Minimization for Efficient Color Image Processing', they propose to use an augmented Lagrangian approach to design an efficient and accurate regularization framework for color image processing by minimizing the Polyakov action, extending the augmented Lagrangian framework for total variation (TV) image denoising to the more general Polyakov action case for color images, and apply the proposed
framework to denoise and deblur color images.
